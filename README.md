demo video: https://youtu.be/OszwcE9jCHY  
Result and marker data would be save in two new folder under source image's folder.  
Save the result from grabcut of OpenCV (http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d1b/group__imgproc__misc.html#ga909c1dda50efcbeaa3ce126be862b37f&gsc.tab=0) without interpolation for GUI.  
Implement multi-layer image viewer without interpolation by QGL of Qt 5.5. Could zoom-in, zoom-out and pan by mouse  
Depends on Qt 5.5 and OpenCV 3
